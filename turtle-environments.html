                Turtles are hardy animals that live in areas of either water or land, such as marshes, swamps, and ponds, and are quite versatile. It is important to note that all tortoises are also turtles (though not all turtles are tortoises) (britannica.com and naturemuseum.org), and tortoises are exclusively land animals - but not all exclusively land turtles are tortoises. Confusing, isn't it? Even still, a lot of turtles do require areas of both water and land to survive, as their capability to swim is what allows those species to hunt and interact with their environment.

            Quitobaquito Springs is a great example of an environment for a turtle, in this case the Sonoyta Mud Turtle. It is now a part of a national park, meaning that humans will never ruin this home for the turtles, which is amazing considering this is the only place where this turtle is found in the United States, so this home needs to be protected, which the NPS (National Park Service) has been incredibly diligent in ensuring this happens for these turtles, as well as the many other creatures that live here, not the mention the history of the area that needs to be preserved as well.
