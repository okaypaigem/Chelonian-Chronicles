                Tortoises are animals that are specifically designed for terrestrial travel and living, and unlike their cousins they are not built for swimming in the slightest. Many tortoises even live in places that are known for lacking water, such as deserts and savannahs. Tortoises are built for longevity in harsh conditions by taking it slow and steady, but living incredibly long and interesting lives. Their shells and tough skin helps them against the predators in these harsh environments and overall incredibly unique and hardy animals.

            Although different tortoises have a wide array of adaptations to survive their differing environments, let's have a closer look at the Desert Tortoise to see how it survives in it's environment- the harsh Sonoran Desert! To escape the heat, tortoises will burrow into the land in order, avoiding the harsh rays of the sun where they can. They eat herbivores, so they don't need to worry about catching prey! They're adapted to eat many plants, and can even eat some cacti! They also have claws that can help them walk on and up rough surfaces. Tortoises also have a great memory, which can be used to remember important locations in their habitat, causing them to utilize the space better. This also helps them considering their long lifespan! Another way Desert Tortoises survive in the unforgiving desert is their ability to tolerate levels of urea in their system that would normally have drastic consequences for another animal, this enables them to go without peeing longer and therefore hold moisture in their bodies a lot longer. They also don't need to eat as often. (desertmuseum.org and tortoiseresourcecenter.com)
