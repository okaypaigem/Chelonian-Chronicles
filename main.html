      <p>
        Chelonians (turtles, tortoises, and terrapins) are one of the oldest reptiles,  
        surviving unchanged for over 200 million years. They range from the tiny bog turtle 
        to huge leatherback sea turtle and right into dry deserts 
        and volcanic islands! The Chelonian Chronicles aims to give a brief overview of this to beginning and eager learners of all ages and backgrounds in 
        order to educate and quickly give off information about these wonderful creatures.

      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <details>
        <summary>What’s the difference between a tortoise and a turtle?</summary>
        <p>
          Tortoises are strictly land-dwellers with domed shells and sturdy, column-like legs. 
          All tortoises are in fact turtles! (britannica.com and naturemuseum.org) However, many non-tortoise turtles - but not all! - spend most of their life in or near water, have flatter shells, and webbed feet.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How do they adapt to extreme heat and drought?</summary>
        <p>
          Tortoises in arid regions like the Sonoran Desert create burrows for shelter and conserve water in their bladders. 
					Mud turtles, though semi-aquatic, rely on limited desert water sources and have adaptations to survive dry periods.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What do tortoises and turtles eat?</summary>
        <p>
          Most are herbivores—grazing on grasses, leafy plants, and fruits. Some species 
          may opportunistically eat insects, carrion, or aquatic invertebrates.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Why do some tortoises live over 100 years?</summary>
        <p>
          A very slow metabolism, few natural predators (especially on islands),  
          and a sturdy shell all contribute to extraordinary longevity.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What are some threats to tortoises and turtles?</summary>
        <p>
          Habitat destruction, climate change, illegal pet trade, and predation threaten their populations. 
					Conservation efforts focus on protecting their environments and reducing human impact.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Where can I see them in the wild?</summary>
        <p>
          Sonoran Desert Tortoises: Saguaro National Park &amp; nearby reserves in Arizona.  
          Sonoran Mud Turtles: Quitobaquito Springs (organ pipe cactus NM).  
          Galápagos Tortoises: Galápagos Islands (Ecuador).
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Which organizations protect chelonians?</summary>
        <p>
          Look for groups like the Turtle Conservancy, Wildlife Conservation Society, 
          and local land trusts in your region to get involved or donate.
        </p>
      </details>

			<details>
        <summary>How can I help conserve tortoises and turtles?</summary>
        <p>
          You can support conservation organizations, avoid purchasing wild-caught tortoises or turtles, 
					and ensure their habitats remain protected. Raising awareness about endangered species like Sonoran Mud Turtles is also crucial.
